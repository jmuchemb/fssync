Change History
==============

1.1 (2014-03-10)
----------------

- Destination side failed at synchronizing extended attributes.
- README: What is not synchronized is documented in paragraph 4
  of BUGS/LIMITATIONS/TODO section.
- Better support of mount points, to safely synchronize when everything is
  unmounted, without having to explicitly filter them. Instead of deleting
  inodes (usually empty directories) that get masked by other filesystems,
  fssync now checks these inodes don't appear in the visible/synchronized tree.
  `fssync_root` example is updated to reflect this.

1.0 (2013-12-18)
----------------

Initial release.
