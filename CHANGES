Change History
==============

1.2 (2014-06-24)
----------------

- The modification time of a directory could be wrongly left altered after
  children were synchronized. This case happened when the source timestamp
  was explicitly restored to its original value, in such way that fssync
  thought metadata were the same on both sides.
- All failures due to a missing inode on destination side should be fixed,
  with a warning. If this inode was already visited, it is required to run
  fssync again to restore. Of course, fssync should be the only process that
  modifies destination which means such case should not happen, but it's simple
  and safe to recover.
- Default value of -R option is documented and fixed.

1.1 (2014-03-10)
----------------

- Destination side failed at synchronizing extended attributes.
- README: What is not synchronized is documented in paragraph 4
  of BUGS/LIMITATIONS/TODO section.
- Better support of mount points, to safely synchronize when everything is
  unmounted, without having to explicitly filter them. Instead of deleting
  inodes (usually empty directories) that get masked by other filesystems,
  fssync now checks these inodes don't appear in the visible/synchronized tree.
  `fssync_root` example is updated to reflect this.

1.0 (2013-12-18)
----------------

Initial release.
